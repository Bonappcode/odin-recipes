The Odin Project - Odin Recipes

This project is another tutorial project, this is the first assignment from The Odin Project. I'm hoping to exhibit the HTML and CSS I have learnt so far.
I'm also hoping to receive some feedback, and advice from other coders please.

Been away for a while life and bills have been too busy. Finish these courses so you can earn more to stop life and bills being so busy!

BonApp is back!

Following Odin Projects instructions to build the start of the recipe pages web site. 
Whilst building these simple pages I have become familiar with VSCode and I have gotten quicker and less prone to mistakes. Also learnt a few helpful shortcuts and features VSCode has.
We have covered adding links, images and how to make it all functional.
I have also added a few comments in to the html to remind me of some ideas I had whilst building the pages to Odin Projects specifications. 

I'm going to borrow some images from various sources inlcuding a friends cafe's website Cafe Chaud Morzine, thanks Kyle! I'm doing this to save time on the graphics and design side of things. I primarily want to get to grips with the language side of thigns without spending hours agonizing over a logo, title or names.
